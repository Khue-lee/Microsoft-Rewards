# What is Microsoft-Rewards
Microsoft-Rewards formly known as Bing-Rewards, allows you to exchange points for gift cards. To accumulate these points you have use the search engine bing. The majority of the points comes from searching and there are two possible ways to get these points. Because of how the elements are displayed on their search engine you can simply click to simulate searching as you are going to a new page. The approach I took was to type phrases into the search bar to accumulate my points, but this script takes care of that for you. The other portion of the points comes from the links on the front page and quizes of random facts given four options and finding the correct answer.
